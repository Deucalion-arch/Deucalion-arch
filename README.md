👋 Hi, I’m @Deucalion-arch (Inspired by Teen Wolf and my love for werewolves)
👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, web development, Flask, and creating secure and efficient websites.
🌱 I’m currently learning Java and deepening my Flask development skills for my web-based application project at DUT.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects, especially those involving Flask, Java. I’m also open to opportunities for part-time or full-time work in the smart home tech space.
😄 Pronouns: HIM 
⚡ Fun fact: I consider werewolves my spirit animal!
